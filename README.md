# 202005-12-Advance-KYC-Risk-Analysis-and-Default-Prediction
This is the course project for EECS6895 Spring2020. 

### Intro
Analyzing risks of investment has been a large topic over years. In this project, we quantified company risks and the likelihood of default by market capitalization. A prediction model based on the random forest was built with R2 = 0.65. The result was interpreted with the example of Shutterfly Inc. Also, we established an interactive platform based on R Shiny App, which support visualization, sentiment analysis, prediction and downloading the results carried out by our model.


The work was done by Xinyi Zhang (xz2862) and Qiaoge Zhu (zq2383).
