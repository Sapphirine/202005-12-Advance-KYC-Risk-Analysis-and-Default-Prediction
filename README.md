Analysis of stock risks and platform to show the results.

Analyzing risks of investment has been a large topic over years. In this project, we quantified company risks and the likelihood of default by market capitalization. A prediction model based on the random forest was built with R2 = 0.65. The result was interpreted with the example of Shutterfly Inc. Also, we established an interactive platform based on R Shiny App, which support visualization, sentiment analysis, prediction and downloading the results carried out by our model.
